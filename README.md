# Understanding Jakarta Floods Using Data

This project called "Understanding Jakarta Floods Using Data" is my final capstone project to complete the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. The purpose of this project is to understand more of the nature of what seems like an ever-present phenomenon in Indonesia capital, which is flooding, by utilizing data. 

## Problem

Flood is an ever-present problem in Jakarta and it occurs annually or even monthly there. It is always the same old story that the flood seems not regressed at all as the year progressed. In fact, only in 2018, flood occupied nearly 50% of the natural disasters occured in Jakarta and many people are forced to relocate from their own house. 

## Motivation

Based on the problem above, hopefully an insight about why, when, where, and what can be done about floods can be answered using the data. In order to achive the result, there are four questions that are going to be covered in this project. These questions are:
- What is the possible explanatory variable for floods? In this step, the correlation between rainfall rate and the occurrence of floods is investigated. 
- Can we actually predict the amount of subdistricts or people that will be affected by flood just by looking at the rainfall rate? 
- If we can predict the amount of subdistricts that will be affected by floods, then which districts that we should focus our attention to when the heavy rainfall pours down the city? 
- Are the amount of parks in a given district actually helpful to mitigate the floods? 

## Files

There two folders, two PDF files, and one Jupyter Notebook file in this project:
- Dataset - contains all of the datasets being used in this project.
- LaTex - contains all of the tex documents needed to create an official report for this project.
- Understanding Jakarta Floods PPT.pdf - presentation slide for this project.
- Understanding Jakarta Floods Using Data.pdf - the official report for this project.
- Understanding Jakarta Floods Using Data.ipynb - contains all of the code and a walkthrough step-by-step report for this project.
